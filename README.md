**Please read the terms.** 

  A response which points me to your website as containing the information I seek, means you, on behalf of your organization, accept these new terms. These new terms fully replace our current contract as of writing this. (as they appeared upon signing.) In other words, in other words, every current standing contract term, and your right to pursue any legal action are void. instead, You. having the authority to enter into contract on behalf of your partners (at least 57 sites total owned by at least 8 LLC's, and half of you are registered in the same city in bulgaria. Though i know there are more and that you are essentially a single company for all practical purposes.)) ,  you agree to send two goats and a pig to CDI college 5021 Kingsway #500, Burnaby, BC V5H 4A5. Further you grant the creator of the account name italicliqued) a irrevocable perpetual global license to all information I can acquire from your websites.

However if you do not agree with these new terms reply any any manner other than pointing me back the site as containing more information than i already have in regards to who all holds my information (the name off each LLC parent company and subsidiary that you share my information with and website and contact information.
